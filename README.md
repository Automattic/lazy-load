# Lazy Load (WordPress Plugin)

> ⚠️ **This plugin is deprecated**

> Lazy Loading functionality is now [built-in to WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/14/lazy-loading-images-in-5-5/) (and further enhanced via [plugins like Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/support/lazy-images/)). We recommend using the core and Jetpack functionality instead for better performance.
